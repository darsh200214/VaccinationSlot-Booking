# VaccinationSlot-Booking
A database mini project used to book the vaccination slots based on the time slots and number of doses available

This system provides the individual an online platform in which they can schedule their vaccination on their desired date and location. The system stores the list of locations of vaccination and a maximum number of people who can get vaccinated per day. The people can simply select the area or location, where and when they wish to schedule their vaccination. This public website shows a calendar to select the desired date for the vaccination. The user will fill up the necessary details and will get his/her schedule for getting vaccine. This project contains an Admin and the User side, where Admins are hospitals who have the list of all people who have booked their slots for getting vaccinated. The Users have their bookings details in the dashboard. 
          
It is one of the most commonly used web-based applications which enables individuals to securely and conveniently book their reservations and requests online via a laptop, tablet, smartphone, computer, and other web-connected devices. The required software and hardware are easily available and easy to work with. Slot booking for vaccination, as described above, can lead to error-free, secure, reliable and fast management systems
